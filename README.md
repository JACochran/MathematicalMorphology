# MathematicalMorphology

A Mapping application that can calculate the Minkowski Sum of two polygons using two different approaches.
The first approach is the Minkowski Sum with the Convex Hull which only works with two Convex Polygons 


Will also be able to visualize the various steps of how the Minkowski Sum is calculated.
After drawing two polygons on the map


## Getting Started
